### Title 

Influence of Multicollinearity on Measured Impact of Right-to-Carry Gun Laws Part 1


### Motivation 

The influence of the implementation of less restrictive right-to-carry gun laws on violent crime is a historically controversial topic. One reason for the controversy, is concern that some earlier reports examining this topic may have used methods that were inappropriate. 

One of the major concerns is that an earlier report included multiple demographic variables that were collinear with one another. This resulted in different a very coefficient estimate for right-to-carry gun law adoption than other reports that did not include collinear variables. This phenomenon is called [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity), and it can result in aberrant findings for particular explanatory variables, despite not altering the overall predictive power of a model.

In the next case study we perform a simplified analysis similar to those of these reports on this topic to explore the influence of multicollinearity on coefficient estimate stability. We however, do not recreate the previous analyses. 

The reports that we use as a guide for our analysis are:

1. John J. Donohue et al., Right‐to‐Carry Laws and Violent Crime: A Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State‐Level Synthetic Control Analysis. *Journal of Empirical Legal Studies*, 16,2 (2019).

2. David B. Mustard & John Lott. Crime, Deterrence, and Right-to-Carry Concealed Handguns. *Coase-Sandor Institute for Law & Economics* Working Paper No. 41, (1996).

### Motivating question

1) How does the inclusion of different numbers of age groups influence the results of an analysis of right to carry laws and violence rates?

### Data   

In this case study, we perform analyses similar to those in [Donohue, et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf){target="_blank"} article and the [Lott and Mustard](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&context=law_and_economics){target="_blank"} article, however **we do not try to recreate them**, instead we perform simplified analyses to allow us to focus on multicollinearity.

Therefore we use a subset of the **explanatory variables** used by each article including:   

1. Data about state demographics in terms of population compositions for age, sex, race, as well as overall population values from the US Census Bureau:

---------- |-------------
**years 1977 to 1979**  | [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1900-1980/state/asrh/)  
**years 1980 to 1989**  | [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1980-1990/counties/asrh/) * county data was used for this decade which also has state information
**years 1990 to 1999**  | [link](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/1990-2000/state/asrh/)
**years 2000 to 2010**  | [link](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-state.html) <br> [technical documentation](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/file-layouts/2000-2010/intercensal/state/st-est00int-alldata.pdf){target="_blank"}

Six demographic variables are created for the [Donohue, et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf){target="_blank"}-like analysis and 36 were created for the [Lott and Mustard](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1150&context=law_and_economics){target="_blank"}-like analysis.

To use this data, we also need [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) state codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code){target="_blank", to identify what demographic data corresponds to what state. This is also available from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/2014/demo/popest/2014-geocodes-state.html){target="_blank"}.

2. Police staffing data, which was downloaded from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs){target="_blank"}

3. Unemployment data, which was downloaded from the [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/dsrv?la){target="_blank"}. 

4. Poverty data, extracted from Table 21 from this [US Census Bureau Poverty Data ](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-people.html){target="_blank"}

5. Right-to-carry law data, which is available in a table in the [Donohue paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23510.pdf){target="_blank"}

Finally our outcome of interest is violent crime rates. The violent crime data was downloaded from the [FBI uniform crime reporting system](https://www.ucrdatatool.gov/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm){target="_blank"}


#### Learning Objectives

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:

<u>**Data Science Learning Objectives:**</u>

1. Data import of many different file types with special cases (`readr`, `readxl`, `pdftools`)  
2. Joining data from multiple sources (`dplyr`)  
3. Working with character strings (`stringr`)  
4. Data comparisons (`dplyr` and `janitor`)  
5. Reshaping data into different formats (`tidyr`)  



#### Data import 

In this case study particularly covers many different types of data import. We cover data import using the Tidyverse `readr` package to import the various types of text files, the Tidyverse `readxl` package to import excel files, and the Tidyverse `pdftools` package to import a PDF file. We demonstrate special cases where header rows need to be skipped, or column data types need to be specified. We also use the the `list.files()` base function together with the `map()` function of the Tidyverse `purrr` package to efficiently perform data importation of multiple files with one command.

#### Data wrangling

This case study is covers many details about wrangling data from excel files with unusual header structures and with similar data in multiple tables within the same file. This involves using the `stringr` package to split, subset, detect, extract, and modify patterns of text. This also involves using the `tidyr` package to change data shape and using the `dplyr` package to summarize, select, filter, modify, and join data. They case study also covers using various `map_*()` functions of the `purrr` package to perform functions across tibbles within lists and the `across()` function of the `dplyr` package to perform functions across columns of an individual tibble. This case study provides especially diverse material about data wrangling.


See [this case study](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-RTC-analysis) for part 2 which includes the following sections:

#### Data Visualization

The next [case study](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-RTC-analysis) demonstrates how to make correlation plots and scatter plots with error bars. We also show how to add formulas and arrows to plots. The instruction about data visualization assumes that students have some familiarity with `ggplot2`.

### Analysis

The next [case study](https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-RTC-analysis) covers balanced panel regression model data analysis with fixed effects. In doing so we provide an introduction to longitudinal analysis in general, as well as use of the `plm` package. We also show how to calculate [Variance inflation factor (VIF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_inflation_factor) values  using the `car` package to quantify the severity of multicollinearity. As another assessment of multicollinearity, we demonstrate how to perform simulations to evaluate the stability of coefficient estimates.
